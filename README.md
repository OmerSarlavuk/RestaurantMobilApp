# Smart Restaurant Mobil Application

Smart Restaurant application is an application where users can order from the mobile application and these orders can be viewed and managed by the restaurant. With this application, customers can manage their orders directly from the mobile application and these orders can be viewed and prepared on the screen in the restaurant. In this way, time is saved and the waiter service burden can be reduced.

Regardless of the restaurant, users can get recipes for meals or learn the ingredients of unfamiliar dishes. Thanks to the artificial intelligence integration, the user can learn and cook any dish he wants.

 In Vigenere encryption, encryption occurs only through the letters of the alphabet. Its shortcoming is that it ignores the characters. Here, encryption is performed for chars (characters, letters, symbols) with decimal range [33-126] in the ASCII table. This means that data is encrypted no matter how. Here, the range [33-126] is placed as rows and columns. Then, it decreases and changes, one under the other, until the last one reaches the beginning. Data is written overlapping with a predetermined key, and each overlapping character is multiplied into the resulting vigenere matrix. The new corresponding character is now an encrypted character.
